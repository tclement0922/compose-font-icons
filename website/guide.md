# Get started

> [!NOTE]
> iOS and macOS are not tested as much as the other targets. There should not be any issue however, since they use the
> same rendering as every other non-Android target.

This library supports the [Compose Multiplatform Common resources API](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/kotlin-multiplatform-dev/compose-images-resources.html)
alongside platform-specific resources like resource IDs for Android, classpath resources for JVM...

Variable fonts are supported, the optical size (`opsz`) and weight (`wgth`) axes will be set automatically depending on the
icon size and provided parameters.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Due to a limitation in the Android API, Android versions older than Oreo (API 26) don't support variable fonts.
> The fonts will render with their default variation values in that case.

# Setup

This library is available on Maven Central and GitHub Packages.

Add this to your build.gradle(.kts):

```kotlin
dependencies {
    implementation("dev.tclement.fonticons:MODULE:VERSION")
}
```

## Modules

### `core`

The main module, providing the core functionality of the library.

### `glance`

A module providing support for AndroidX Glance (Android App Widgets / WearOS Tiles). This module is only compatible with
Android.

# Usage

(Optional) Set the default icon parameters:
```kotlin
ProvideIconParameters(
    iconFont = yourFont,
    tintProvider = LocalContentColor
) {
    // icons here will have by default the params declared above
}
```

> [!TIP]
> Using `ProvideIconParameters` (or equivalent) is recommended. Otherwise, the parameters `iconFont` and `tint` must be
> provided for each icon.

You can then use the `FontIcon` composable to display an icon:
```kotlin
FontIcon(
    icon = MyIconFont.MyIcon, // Here, MyIconFont.MyIcon is a Char equal to the unicode of the icon
    contentDescription = null
)
```
This kind of accessors (*FontName*.*IconName*) can be generated from the [Accessors Generator](/generator) tool.

An alternative function that takes a `String` instead of a `Char` is also available, for fonts that supports ligatures:
```kotlin
FontIcon(
    iconName = "my_icon",
    contentDescription = null
)
```
