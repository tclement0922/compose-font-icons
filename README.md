Makes possible to use icons from a font in JetBrains Compose Multiplatform.
Currently supported targets are Android, Desktop (JVM), Web (JS and WASM), macOS, and iOS.

> [!NOTE]
> iOS and macOS are not tested as much as the other targets. There should not be any issue however, since they use the
> same rendering as every other non-Android target.

This library supports the [Compose Multiplatform Common resources API](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/kotlin-multiplatform-dev/compose-images-resources.html)
alongside platform-specific resources like resource IDs for Android, classpath resources for JVM...

Variable fonts are supported, the optical size (`opsz`) and weight (`wgth`) axes will be set automatically depending on the
icon size and provided parameters.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Due to a limitation in the Android API, Android versions older that Oreo (API 26) don't support variable fonts.

# Setup

This library is available on Maven Central and GitHub Packages. 

Add this to your build.gradle(.kts):

```kotlin
dependencies {
    implementation("dev.tclement.fonticons:MODULE:VERSION")
}
```

## Modules

### `core`

The main module, providing the core functionality of the library.

### `core-glance`

An additional module providing support for AndroidX Glance (Android App Widgets / WearOS Tiles). This is the only module
that is only compatible with Android.

### `font-fa`

This module provides support for the Font Awesome Free font. An icon can be referenced by its name, for example 
`FontAwesome.Regular.Star`. The fonts are not provided in this module, they must either be provided by the user or by 
using the packaged font modules.

### `font-fa-brands`, `font-fa-regular` and `font-fa-solid`

Packaged variants of the Font Awesome Free font[^1]. These modules provide their corresponding font as a resource and a 
function to create this font (`rememberBrandsFontAwesomeFont`, `rememberRegularFontAwesomeFont` or
`rememberSolidFontAwesomeFont`).

[^1]: The Font Awesome Free fonts are licensed under the
  [SIL OFL 1.1 license](https://github.com/FortAwesome/Font-Awesome/blob/6.x/LICENSE.txt)

### `font-symbols`

This module provides support for the Material Symbols variable font. An icon can be referenced by its name, for example
`MaterialSymbols.Star`. The fonts are not provided in this module, they must either be provided by the user or by using 
one of the packaged font modules.

> [!CAUTION]
> Android API 25 and lower don't support variable fonts, this means that variations won't be applied. This font will 
> default to its default settings on those versions.

### `font-symbols-outlined`, `font-symbols-rounded` and `font-symbols-sharp`

Packaged variants of the Material Symbols variable font[^2]. These modules provide their corresponding font as a 
resource and a function to create this font (`rememberOutlinedSymbolsFont`, `rememberRoundedSymbolsFont` or
`rememberMaterialSymbolsFont`).

[^2]: The Material Symbols fonts are licensed under the
  [Apache 2.0 license](https://github.com/google/material-design-icons/blob/master/LICENSE)

# Usage

(Optional) Set the default icon parameters:
```kotlin
ProvideIconParameters(
    iconFont = your_font, // ex: for outlined Material Symbols: rememberOutlinedMaterialSymbolsFont()
    tintProvider = LocalContentColor
) {
    // icons here will have by default the params declared above
}
```

> [!TIP]
> Using `ProvideIconParameters` (or equivalent) is recommended. Otherwise, the parameters `iconFont` and `tint` must be 
> provided for each icon.

You can then use the `FontIcon` composable to display an icon:
```kotlin
FontIcon(
    icon = MaterialSymbols.Star,
    contentDescription = null
)
```

An alternative function that takes a `String` instead of a `Char` is also available, for fonts that supports ligatures:
```kotlin
FontIcon(
    iconName = "star",
    contentDescription = null
)
```
